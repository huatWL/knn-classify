In data mining applications and spatial and multimedia databases, a useful tool is the kNN join, 
which is to produce the k nearest neighbors (NN), from a dataset S, of every point in a dataset R. 
Since it involves both the join and the NN search, performing kNN joins efficiently is a challenging task. 
Meanwhile, applications continue to witness a quick (exponential in some cases) increase in the 
amount of data to be processed. A popular model nowadays for large-scale data processing is the 
shared-nothing cluster on a number of commodity machines using MapReduce . Hence, how to execute 
kNN joins efficiently on large data that are stored in a MapReduce cluster is an intriguing problem 
that meets many practical needs. This work proposes novel (exact and approximate) algorithms in 
MapReduce to perform efficient parallel kNN joins on large data. We demonstrate our ideas using Hadoop. 
Extensive experiments in large real and synthetic datasets, with tens or hundreds of millions of records 
in both R and S and up to 30 dimensions, have demonstrated the efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability of our methods.
